# Microservices Deployment Using Docker, Kubernetes, and Travis CI

## Overview

This project is a CI/CD pipeline utilizing Kubernetes, Docker, and Travis CI. It is structured to deploy multiple services including a client, server, worker, and nginx as a reverse proxy.

## Services

The project consists of the following services defined in the Docker Compose file:

- **Client**: A frontend service running on a Docker container.
- **Server**: A backend API service with environment variables for database and Redis configuration.
- **Worker**: A background worker service that interacts with Redis.
- **Nginx**: Serves as a reverse proxy, routing requests to the appropriate services.

## Configuration

The services are configured with environment variables for Redis and PostgreSQL, ensuring flexibility and ease of deployment across different environments.

### Docker Compose

The Docker Compose setup is defined in `complex/docker-compose.yml`. Key configurations include:

- Memory limits
- Hostnames
- Environment variables for service connectivity

```
startLine: 2
endLine: 30
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is managed with Travis CI, which automates the testing and deployment of the services to a Kubernetes cluster. The pipeline includes stages for building Docker images, running tests, and deploying to Kubernetes.

### Travis CI Configuration

The Travis CI configuration should be defined in a .travis.yml file at the root of the repository. This file would typically include instructions for Travis CI to build Docker images, run tests, and deploy to Kubernetes.

## Deployment

Deployment is managed through Kubernetes, which orchestrates the containers based on the configurations specified in Kubernetes manifest files. These files should define the desired state of the services, including the number of replicas, resource limits, and networking settings.

### Kubernetes Manifests

Kubernetes manifests should be placed in a directory, typically named k8s, and include files for each service. These files configure the deployment and service resources in the Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have Docker, Kubernetes, and Travis CI set up. You can start the services locally by running:

```
docker-compose -f complex/docker-compose.yml up
```

For deploying to a Kubernetes cluster, ensure your kubectl is configured correctly and apply the Kubernetes manifests:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a robust setup for a microservices architecture using Docker, Kubernetes, and Travis CI for continuous integration and deployment.
